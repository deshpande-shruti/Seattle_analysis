### Project motivation
For this project, i was interested in the Seattle Airbnb data for analysing tourist activities in the city, here are the following questions:
1. Which are the most Popular destinations in Seattle?
2. Which neighbourhood's would continue to record an increasing number of tourists based on rating scores given by previous visitors?
3. What are the earnings and reviews by host?
4. How much should the host set their price of listings?

### File description
There exist 2 files in this repository, 
1. A csv file that contains data containing information of airbnb subscribers in Seattle. 
2. A Jupyter notebook(.ipynb) that contains the analysis of data.

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@sonyand96/a-sneek-peek-into-seattle-airbnb-data-b7ff153da277)
